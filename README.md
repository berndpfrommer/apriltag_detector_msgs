# ROS/ROS2 package with Apriltag detector messages

This package has definitions for ROS / ROS2 apriltag detector
messages. These messages are emitted by the
[ROS Apriltag detector](https://github.com/berndpfrommer/apriltag_detector).

The messages in this package are almost identical to those of the
[ROS Apriltag package](https://github.com/versatran01/apriltag). No
derived quantities (e.g. homographies and poses) are provided, just
the basic perception information like corners, tag family, and identity.
